The task was to review publications from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). You are required to draft an email to inform the relevant infrastructure owners of the seriousness of the vulnerability that has been reported. The research was first done on the Lo4j zero-day vulnerability published by CISA. Information gathered was drafted into a mail and sent to teams that may be vulnerable. It was realised that the Product Development Team had the Log4j service installed, and so the mail was tailored to that infrastructure. <br/>

The next step was to write a Python script to brute force the encrypted key for the ransomware file. With youtube research and practice, I could write a Python script to brute force the Python key. Though my script did not brute force the key I had the opportunity to try again with the sample script as shown below. <br/>

<br /> The correct script and exceution looks like this <br/>
